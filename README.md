Hi! I'm Ola 🙋‍♀️

For the last few years I've been working as a freelance copywriter and content writer, managing my own websites (especially one with fit food review) and doing some things related with SEO.

🤖 However, I have always wanted to connect the work with my mathematical mind and love for logic.

I made a decision to change my career path.
I want to be a programmer. I would like to focus on backend.
I've been learning Python for several months. At that time, I also caught the basics of postgreSQL and took a look on HTML.🤪



Wish me luck! 
Any tips would be appreciated. Open to contact with U 🤝
